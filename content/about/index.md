# About Me

I’m Pete. I’m a *lead interaction designer* working for the *Department for Work and Pensions* on *Health and Disability services*.

I’m passionate about using design as a tool for social good. We have a responsibility to use what we do in a manner that is *ethical*, *accessible*, and *beneficial for the public*.

My present role involves heading up interaction design across a portfolio of services that help people living with a health condition or disability to access help and support.

In the past I have worked for a number of clients and companies including RIBA Enterprises, HMRC, Virgin Money and Sadiq Khan.
